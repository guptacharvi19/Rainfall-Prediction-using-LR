# Rainfall-Prediction-system

This project is a **Rainfall Prediction System** built with **Python** and **Streamlit**.  
It predicts monthly rainfall (in mm) for different states in India based on climate inputs like temperature, humidity, and wind speed using **Linear Regression**.


## Features

- Predicts rainfall based on:
  - State (Maharashtra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Punjab)
  - Month (Jan–Oct)
  - Average temperature (°C)
  - Humidity (%)
  - Wind speed (km/h)
- Shows a preview of the dataset (simulated data)
- Interactive **Streamlit web interface** for input and prediction
- Easily extendable for real datasets
